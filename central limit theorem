1. What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important?

In situations, such as the original problem we discussed of estimating average human height,
we won’t know the true population mean and variance. 
Understanding the nuances of sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem is an 
essential first step toward talking many of these problems.

Formally, it states that if we sample from a population using a sufficiently large sample size, 
the mean of the samples (also known as the sample population) will be normally distributed (assuming true random sampling). 
What’s especially important is that this will be true regardless of the distribution of the original population.
As the sample size N is increased, the resultant sample mean distribution becomes more normal. 

Further, the distribution variance also decreases. we are considering more samples when using a larger sample size, 
and are more likely to get a representative sample of the population. So roughly speaking, if the sample size used is large enough, 
there is a good chance that it will estimate the population pretty well. 
Most sources state that for most applications N = 30 is sufficient.

In general, mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean equals to the mean of the original population
Variance of the sampling distribution of the sample mean equals to the variance of the original population divided by the sample size.
