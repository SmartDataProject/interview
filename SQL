1.What is the purpose of the group functions in SQL? Give some examples of group functions.
Group functions are necessary to get summary statistics of a dataset. COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, and DISTINCT are all group functions

2. Tell me the difference between an inner join, left join/right join, and union.
   - INNER JOIN: (the typical Join operation, which uses some comparison operator like = or ). These include equi-joins and natural joins.
Inner Joins use a comparison operator to match rows from two tables based on the values in common columns from each table.

   - OUTER JOIN: Outer joins can be a Left, a Right, or Full Outer Join.
Outer joins are specified with one of the following sets of keywords when they are specified in the FROM clause:

   1) LEFT JOIN or LEFT OUTER JOIN: The result set of a Left Outer Join includes all the rows from the left table specified in 
   the LEFT OUTER clause, not just the ones in which the joined columns match. 
   When a row in the left table has no matching rows in the right table, 
   the associated result set row contains null values for all select list columns coming from the right table.

   2) RIGHT JOIN or RIGHT OUTER JOIN: A Right Outer Join is the reverse of a Left Outer Join. 
   All rows from the right table are returned. Null values are returned for the left table any time a right table row
   has no matching row in the left table.

   3) FULL JOIN or FULL OUTER JOIN: A Full Outer Join returns all rows in both the Left and Right tables. 
   Any time a row has no match in the other table, the select list columns from the other table contain null values.
   When there is a match between the tables, the entire result set row contains data values from the base tables.


3. What does UNION do? What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

4. What is the difference between SQL and MySQL or SQL Server?

5. If a table contains duplicate rows, does a query result display the duplicate values by default? 
How can you eliminate duplicate rows from a query result?
