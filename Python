3. What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?
List is mutable and tuples is immutable. The main difference between mutable and immutable is memory usage
when you are trying to append an item. When you create a variable, some fixed memory is assigned to the variable. 
If it is a list, more memory is assigned than actually used.
(an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. 
This is in contrast to a mutable object, which can be modified after it is created.)
