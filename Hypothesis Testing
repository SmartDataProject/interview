4. What do the terms Hypothesis testing, P-value, coefficient, R-Squared value mean?
   
   - Hypothesis testing: based on probability, a method of making decisions about population by using a sample data 
   
   - process:
     1) define study question and choose test: what variables will be used to test the question?
     2) set null and alternative hypothesis: statement that you are looking for evidence to disprove (easier to disprove than prove)
     e.g. there is no difference in the population means
     e.g. there is no relationship between class and survival
     e.g. the mean weekly hours for people in the UK are the same as in Germany
     3)  calculate a test statistic and it's p-value:
     Test statistic is a number calculated from sample data to decide whether to reject the NH about the population or not (varies by test 
     but generally either comparess the observed and expected values or a difference divided by variability)
     If you repeated the study numerous times you would get a variety of test statistics which form a distribution
     p-value is the probablity of getting a test statistic as extreme as the one calcuated from the sample data, if the NH is true.
     4) compare p-value with a cutoff value/significant level (such as 0.05 and 0.01)
     5) make a decision and conclusion
     if p-value < 0.05, the results are statistically significant, evidence to reject NH
     if p-value < 0.01, strong evidence to reject the NH
     
   - R-squared:
     R-squared is selected as the statistical index to measure how well different machine learning algorithms built from the 
     input data perform. R-squared is defined as:
     R^2=1-  RSS/TSS
     Where RSS is the residual sum of squares:
       ∑▒〖(y_true-y_predict)〗^2 
     And TSS is the total sum of squares:
       ∑▒〖(y_true-mean_of_y_true)〗^2 
     R-squared measures the proportion of variability in the output variable Y that can be explained using the model built
     from the input data X.  The best prediction result is when R-squared is equal to 1. 
     When R-squared is equal to 0, it means the machine learning model makes a constant prediction with the expected value 
     of the output variable Y. In this case, R-squared can be negative when the model is really worse near a random prediction.  
     
5. What is the difference between Type I vs Type II error?
Whether you decided to reject the NH or not, you may make a mistake
   - Type 1 error: probability to reject the NH when it is actually true, equal to the p-value, False Positive
   - Type 2 error: probability not to reject the NH when it is false, False Negative (e.g. releasing a guilty man)
