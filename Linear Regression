2. What is linear regression?

3. What are the assumptions required for linear regression?
There are four major assumptions: 
- There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the regressors, 
meaning the model you are creating actually fits the data, 
- The errors or residuals of the data are normally distributed and independent from each other, 
- There is minimal multicollinearity between explanatory variables,and 
- Homoscedasticity. This means the variance around the regression line is the same for all values of the predictor variable.
