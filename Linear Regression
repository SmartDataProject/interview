2. What is linear regression?
   - is there a linear relationship? scatter plot
   - is it significant? p<0.05 then the predictor is a significant predictor
   - interpret the coefficients
   - R-squared: how much variance is explained by the model
   - have the assumptions been met? Histogram of residual is normally distributed and no pattern in predicted value vas residual plot
   (if not, try ln(y) first)
   
3. What are the assumptions required for linear regression?
There are four major assumptions: 
   - the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear: scatter plot
   - Homoscedasticity: the variance of the residuals about the predicted responses should be the same for all predicted responses.
     This means the variance around the regression line is the same for all values of the predictor variable.
     scatter plot of standardised predicted values (x) and standardised residuals(y), should be random, no apparent shape
   - The errors or residuals of the data are normally distributed: plot the residuals in a histogram
   - the residuals are independent: durbin watson statistic, There is minimal multicollinearity between explanatory variable
